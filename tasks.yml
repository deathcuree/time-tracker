name: "Delete Single Time Entry Feature"
description: |
  Add a feature in the time-tracking application to allow users to delete a single
  time entry (not all entries). The backend already exists in Node.js/Express with
  MongoDB, and the frontend is in React with Tailwind. The API integration, routes,
  and authentication middleware are already in place.

tasks:
  - name: "Backend - Add DELETE Route"
    details: |
      1. In `time.routes.js`, add a DELETE route:
         - Endpoint: DELETE /api/time/entries/:id
         - Must use the existing `auth` middleware
         - Should call a new controller function: deleteTimeEntry
      2. In `time.controller.js`, implement `deleteTimeEntry`:
         - Delete the entry by its `_id`
         - Verify that it belongs to the authenticated user
         - Return JSON:
           {
             "success": true,
             "message": "Time entry deleted successfully",
             "deletedId": "..."
           }
         - If not found → return 404
         - If unauthorized → return 403
      3. Ensure error handling and proper async/await usage.

  - name: "Frontend - Add Delete Button"
    details: |
      1. On the time history list, add a delete button beside each entry.
      2. Button behavior:
         - Confirm with the user before deleting
         - Call axios.delete("/api/time/entries/:id")
         - On success → remove entry from UI state without full reload
         - On error → show toast or inline error
      3. Use Tailwind styles and keep consistent with current UI.
      4. Use existing axios instance if available.
      5. Implement optimistic update: remove from UI immediately, rollback if API fails.

  - name: "Expectations"
    details: |
      - Code must be clean, modular, and production-grade.
      - Must follow existing conventions.
      - Do not remove or alter current functionality (clock-in, clock-out, etc.).
      - Include complete code snippets for router, controller, and React component updates.
      - Provide proper error handling and status codes.
